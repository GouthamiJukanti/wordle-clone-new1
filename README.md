This project is a simple clone of the popular word-guessing game built with React for the first time. This was my first real dive into React, and although the code is bloated and messy (as I was still learning!), it’s a good snapshot of my early journey into web development.

The game follows the same mechanics as Wordle: you must guess a 5-letter word in 6 tries, with feedback after each guess that tells you which letters are correct or in the wrong position.
## ✨ Features

- **Color-Coded Feedback**:
  - 🟩 **Green**: Correct letter, correct position.
  - 🟨 **Yellow**: Correct letter, wrong position.
  - ⬜ **Gray**: Incorrect letter.
- **Multiple Tries**: You get 6 attempts to guess the word.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Game Reset**: Refresh the page to get a new word and start again.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: My first experience using React, focusing on components and state management.
- **JSX**: Integrated HTML-like syntax within JavaScript for UI components.
- **CSS**: Styled the game with a simple, clean layout inspired by the original Wordle.
- **Node.js (with npm)**: Managed dependencies and built the project.
